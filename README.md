## What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method used in telecommunications to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called **dits** and **dahs**. It was devised by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s.

### Key Features of Morse Code:
- **Dits** represent a short signal, and **dahs** represent a longer signal.
- The duration of a dit is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code.
- A dah is three times the duration of a dit.
- The space between letters is equal to three dits, and the space between words is equal to seven dits.

Morse code has been historically used in war communications but remains in use today in various applications such as aviation, maritime, and amateur radio.

### Example Morse Code Table:

| Letter | Morse Code |
|--------|------------|
| A      | .-         |
| B      | -...       |
| C      | -.-.       |
