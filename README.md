## About the App

This app allows users to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. It also provides functionalities such as:

- Flashing Morse code using the device's flashlight.
- Sending Morse code messages via SMS.
- Decrypting received Morse code messages.

## What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method used in telecommunications to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called **dits** and **dahs**. It was devised by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s.

### Key Features of Morse Code:
- **Dits** represent a short signal, and **dahs** represent a longer signal.
- The duration of a dit is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code.
- A dah is three times the duration of a dit.
- The space between letters is equal to three dits, and the space between words is equal to seven dits.

Morse code has been historically used in war communications but remains in use today in various applications such as aviation, maritime, and amateur radio.

### Example Morse Code Table:

| Letter | Morse Code |
|--------|------------|
| A      | .-         |
| B      | -...       |
| C      | -.-.       |
| ...    | ...        |
